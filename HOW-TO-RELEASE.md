How To Release
--------

#### 1. Update Documents

Update `README.md`, `README.md.ja`, `CHANGE.md` and `CHANGE.md.ja`.

#### 2. Publish Library

Go to [Github Release page][GithubReleasePage] and release a new version
(See [this page][GithubManagingRelease] for more details about releasing).

Creating a new release automatically triggers a webhook which publishes
the new version to [deno.land/x][DenoLandX].
